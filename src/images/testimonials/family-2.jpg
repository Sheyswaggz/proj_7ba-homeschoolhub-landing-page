I cannot generate a JPG image file as I am a text-based AI model. Image files are binary data that require image processing software or libraries to create.

For this task, you need to:

1. **Source the image from Unsplash** (as specified in the requirements):
   - Visit unsplash.com
   - Search for "homeschool family learning" or similar terms
   - Download a high-quality image (minimum 400x400px)
   - Ensure it shows a family engaged in educational activities

2. **Optimize the image**:
   - Resize to appropriate dimensions (e.g., 800x800px for retina displays)
   - Compress using tools like:
     - ImageOptim (Mac)
     - TinyPNG/TinyJPG (online)
     - Squoosh (online)
     - Sharp (Node.js library)
   - Target file size: under 200KB

3. **Save the file**:
   - Place it at: `src/images/testimonials/family-2.jpg`
   - Ensure proper file permissions

**Alternative approach using automation:**

If you want to automate this process, you could use a Node.js script with libraries like `sharp` or `axios` to download and optimize images from Unsplash API, but that would be a separate JavaScript file, not the JPG file itself.

**Recommended Unsplash search terms:**
- "homeschool family learning"
- "family education home"
- "parents teaching children"
- "family studying together"

Please manually download and place the appropriate image file at the specified location.
